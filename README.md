# Space Invaders (boogaloo!)

Welcome! This is a project to showcase my skills using the Bevy game engine in Rust. 
It is quite a close copy of the original Space Invaders game as of this moment. 
I am planning to develop more interesting features such as multiplayer, different stages, different enemies, etc.

## How to start
With rust, it is quite simple. Paste the command `cargo run` into the command line and you're good to go! Enjoy space fighting!
